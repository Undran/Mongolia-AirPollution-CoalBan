# Ulaanbaatar Particulate Matter Dataset (2015–2018)

## Dataset Description
This dataset contains hourly PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from 18 monitoring stations in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Data was sourced from the OpenAQ platform. It allows for the analysis of temporal and spatial patterns in air pollution, particularly in Ger districts, and provides a baseline to evaluate the impact of the 2019 raw coal ban.

## Data Dictionary
| Column       | Description                              | Data Type |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| timestamp   | Date and time of measurement             | datetime  |
| station_id  | Monitoring station identifier             | string    |
| pm25        | PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³)             | float     |
| pm10        | PM10 concentration (µg/m³)              | float     |
| latitude    | Latitude of the monitoring station       | float     |
| longitude   | Longitude of the monitoring station      | float     |

## Replicability and Reuse
The dataset is publicly available via Kaggle and OpenAQ. It supports reproducible analyses, though missing values may occur due to station downtime, which must be handled in preprocessing.
