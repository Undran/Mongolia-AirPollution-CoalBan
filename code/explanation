# ML Explanation Notebook

Purpose: Interpret patterns in PM2.5 trends using machine learning.

Steps:
1. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting feature importance.
2. SHAP value analysis for interpretability.
3. Clustering of monitoring stations and months by pollution patterns.
4. Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
5. Visualizations: feature importance charts, SHAP summary plots, cluster heatmaps, decomposed series.

This notebook enriches the exploratory analysis and links ML insights to policy evaluation.
