# Part II – Machine Learning for Explanation  

This section uses machine learning (ML) to **explain and interpret** patterns in the literature, rather than only predicting outcomes.

## 🔍 Methods Used  

### 📘 Topic Modeling (LDA)  
- Groups research papers into themes (e.g., *air pollution health risks*, *renewable energy adoption*).  
- Helps identify dominant discussions and gaps in the literature.  

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis  
- Detects tone (positive, negative, neutral) in policy or public discussion texts.  
- Provides insight into how interventions like the coal ban are framed socially and politically.  

### 🌐 Citation Network Analysis  
- Maps relationships between studies through citations.  
- Highlights **influential authors** and **key papers** shaping the research field.

## 📦 Deliverables  

1. **Preliminary Results**  
   - Topic clusters from LDA.  
   - Sentiment distribution across documents.  
   - Citation network metrics (e.g., central papers).  

2. **Visualizations**  
   - Topic maps / word clouds.  
   - Sentiment histograms.  
   - Citation network diagram.  

3. **Discussion**  
   - What topics dominate research?  
   - How are policies framed?  
   - Which studies are central and influential?  

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes  

- Clearer understanding of **key themes** in the literature.  
- Identification of **sentiment trends** around air pollution and energy policy.  
- Recognition of **research leaders and gaps** to guide further analysis.
