# Exploratory Data Analysis: Ulaanbaatar Air Pollution

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`eda_air_pollution.ipynb`) performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Ulaanbaatar Particulate Matter dataset (2015–2018)**, which includes hourly PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from multiple air quality monitoring stations in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The analysis focuses on **Ger districts**, where air pollution from household coal burning is most severe.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Dataset Download**
   - Programmatically download the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
   - Extract the dataset into the `data/` folder.

2. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Load the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Convert the `timestamp` column to datetime format.
   - Filter for Ger district stations (subset of stations).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.
   - Check for missing values and handle accordingly.
   - Temporal visualization of PM2.5 and PM10 trends.
   - Seasonal decomposition for PM2.5 to detect yearly trends and seasonality.

4. **Visualization**
   - Line plots to visualize PM2.5 and PM10 trends over time.
   - Seasonal decomposition plots to understand cyclic behavior.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- kaggle (for dataset download)

## Purpose
This EDA provides a foundational understanding of air pollution trends in Ulaanbaatar, particularly in Ger districts, which is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of Mongolia’s **2019 raw coal ban**. The cleaned and visualized dataset will be used for further analysis, including time series modeling and counterfactual scenario simulations.
