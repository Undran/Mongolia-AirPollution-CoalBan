# ML Prediction Notebook

Purpose: Predict PM2.5levels and compare algorithm performance.

Steps:
1. Train/test split (pre-2019 for training, post-2019 for testing).
2. Fit Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AutoGluon models.
3. Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, RÂ².
4. Compare predicted vs observed values and residuals.
5. Feature importance analysis to interpret predictions.

This notebook supports predictive modeling and decision-making for air quality interventions.
